# lps_psu_scpi

This code relies on the Pico SCPI labTool code from Jan Cumps:

```
git clone https://github.com/jancumps/pico_scpi_usbtmc_labtool.git --recurse-submodules
```

The code in this lps_psu_scpi repository implements a SCPI interface for Motech LPS300 series power supplies (tested with the LPS304).
